# OrbaC

    The Orbac Project is a small application in Java/Swing meant to facilitate analysing and reviewing corpora. It shoud be a good way of visualizing which texts fill a specific list of criteria.
    
    It was built on a specific case and therfore it might seem a bit "stuck" in the way it works, however it uses the broadest kind of files possible (.txt and .csv) and should be easy to use albeit not so "flexible" in the way it could be configured.
    
    There will be several versions (for both french and english languages), for example one version meant for binary criteria and another for criteria going over 1, so of course there will be notices (in both languages) to every "use-case's" last stable version.
    
    This was done by a team of one(!) junior programmer in a couple week-ends of work, so don't expect too much in-depth analysis or an eye-candy visual but you are free to use it, copy and modify it for your own. You're also welcome to participe and ask for comments or clarification.
    
    Thank you for your interest, and hopefully this small program can be of help to you.
